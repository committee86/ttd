Dear Andrei

## Comments from Wessam Ahmed on January 11, 2024

nice to share my contribution with you the article provides a valuable introduction to the concept of Time to Data (TTD) and its potential benefits for organizations. By addressing the suggested improvements, it could become an even more impactful resource for promoting data accessibility and improving user experience in the data-driven world.
•	You could share your experience implementing TTD pilots and the lessons learned.
•	Consider expanding on the relationship between TTD and other data-related metrics like data quality and processing latency.
•	Explore potential use cases for TTD beyond data provisioning, such as data governance and data discovery.
Some use cases that I  implemented before are below :
•	Customer segmentation for Analyzing customer behavior patterns to create targeted marketing campaigns and personalized experiences.
•	Fraud detection for identifying anomalous transactions or activities to prevent financial losses and security breaches.
•	Process optimization for Identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies in business processes to streamline operations and reduce costs.
•	Personalized recommendations for Providing tailored product suggestions and content based on individual preferences and behaviour.
thanks, I am always here to support and you can also read my articles and share with me your input if you wish
